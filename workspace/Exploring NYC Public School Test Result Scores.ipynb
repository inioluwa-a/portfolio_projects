There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.\n\n# NYC Schools SAT Analysis Project\n\n## Project Instructions\n\n1. **Which NYC schools have the best math results?**\n   - The best math results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score of 800 for math.\n   - Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called `best_math_schools`, including \"school_name\" and \"average_math\" columns, sorted by \"average_math\" in descending order.\n\n2. **What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?**\n   - Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `top_10_schools` containing the \"school_name\" and a new column named \"total_SAT\", with results ordered by \"total_SAT\" in descending order.\n\n3. **Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?**\n   - Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called `largest_std_dev`.\n   - The DataFrame should contain one row, with:\n     - \"borough\" - the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of \"total_SAT\".\n     - \"num_schools\" - the number of schools in the borough.\n     - \"average_SAT\" - the mean of \"total_SAT\".\n     - \"std_SAT\" - the standard deviation of \"total_SAT\".\n   - Round all numeric values to two decimal places.\n","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"STEP 1: Import Necessary Library and Load Data","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8236e2d0-ab47-4356-95a9-34472eaf6048"},{"source":"# Import pandas as pd\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":25,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import pandas as pd\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1722540854831,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":213,"type":"dataFrame"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"b001ec81-08dc-43e0-bcca-59ee53e049cc","visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"},"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":38,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"building_code","type":"string"},{"name":"average_math","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_reading","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_writing","type":"integer"},{"name":"percent_tested","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"school_name":["New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School","Essex Street Academy","Lower Manhattan Arts Academy","High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies","Henry Street School for International Studies"],"borough":["Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan"],"building_code":["M022","M445","M445","M445","M056"],"average_math":[657,395,418,613,410],"average_reading":[601,411,428,453,406],"average_writing":[601,387,415,463,381],"percent_tested":[null,78.9,65.1,95.9,59.7]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
