Welcome to my portfolio projects repository! Here you will find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data science and web development. Each project demonstrates my ability to analyze data, create visualizations, and build web applications.

## Projects

### 1. Investigating Netflix Movies
**Description:** In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Netflix movies from the 1990s. The goal was to understand the distribution of movie durations and identify short action movies.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Exploration:** Familiarized myself with the dataset by checking data types and identifying missing values (none found).
2. **Data Cleaning:** Ensured the dataset was free of inconsistencies and duplicates.
3. **Analysis:** Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
4. **Visualization:** Planned to use Matplotlib for visualizing the distribution of movie durations, but encountered technical issues.

**Results:**
- **Most Frequent Movie Duration (1990s):** The most frequent duration was calculated to be approximately 94 minutes.
- **Count of Short Action Movies (Less than 90 minutes):** There are 7 short action movies from the 1990s.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Gained experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- Encountered and resolved challenges with data visualization using Matplotlib.
- Developed skills in Python data analysis and applied best coding practices.
